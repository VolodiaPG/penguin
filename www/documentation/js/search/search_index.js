corresponding methods:\n\ndebug   : for debug information\ninfo    : for informative status of the application (success, ...)\nwarning : for non-critical errors that do not prevent normal application behavior\nerror   : for critical errors that prevent normal application behavior\n\nExample usage:\n * import { Logger } from 'app/core/logger.service';\n *\n * const log = new Logger('myFile');\n * ...\n * log.debug('something happened');\n * ```\n\nTo disable debug and info logs in production, add this snippet to your root component:\nexport class AppComponent implements OnInit {\nngOnInit() {\nif (environment.production) {\nLogger.enableProductionMode();\n}\n...\n}\n}\n\nIf you want to process logs through other outputs than console, you can add LogOutput functions to

dist/ folder\n\n\nng serve --host 0.0.0.0\nRun development server on http://localhost:4200/\n\n\nyarn run env -s\nFix .env related errors\n\n\nyarn run compodoc\nGenerate the documentation and run documentation server on http://localhost:8080/\n\n\nyarn run compodoc -n\nGenerate the documentation with a certain name\n\n\n\nWhen building the application, you can specify the target configuration using the additional flag\n--configuration  (do not forget to prepend -- to pass arguments to npm scripts).\nThe default build configuration is prod.\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change\nany of the source files.\nYou should not use ng serve directly, as it does not use the backend proxy configuration by default.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ionic generate -- component  to generate a new component. You can also use\nionic generate -- directive|pipe|service|class|module.\nIf you have installed angular-cli globally with npm install -g @angular/cli,\nyou can also use the command ng generate directly.\nAdditional tools\nTasks are mostly based on the angular-cli tool. Use ng help to get more help or go check out the\nAngular-CLI README.\nCode formatting\nAll .ts, .js & .scss files in this project are formatted automatically using Prettier,\nand enforced via the test:ci script.\nA pre-commit git hook has been configured on this project to automatically format staged files, using\n(pretty-quick)[https://github.com/azz/pretty-quick], so you don't have to care for it.\nYou can also force code formatting by running the command npm run prettier.\nWhat's in the box\nThe app template is based on HTML5, TypeScript and\nSass. The translation files use the common JSON format.\nTools\nDevelopment, build and quality processes are based on angular-cli and\nNPM scripts, which includes:\n\nOptimized build and bundling process with Webpack\nDevelopment server with backend proxy and live reload\nCross-browser CSS with autoprefixer and\nbrowserslist\nAsset revisioning for better cache management\nUnit tests using Jasmine and Karma\nEnd-to-end tests using Protractor\nStatic code analysis: TSLint, Codelyzer,\nStylelint and HTMLHint\nLocal knowledgebase server using Hads\nAutomatic code formatting with
